Let's create the HTML code for slide 7, which is about "Week 8: 심화 및 최적화" (Advanced topics and optimization). Based on the content structure from the other slides, I should follow the same design pattern with dark background and colorful accents.

The content should include:

Performance monitoring and optimization
Testing code
Scalability and architecture design practice
Key topics about REST API design
From the main text content, I'll extract the relevant information for Week 8:

🚩 Week 8: 심화 및 최적화
성능 모니터링 및 최적화
백엔드 API 성능 최적화 (비동기 처리, 캐싱)
프론트엔드 최적화 (코드 스플리팅, 캐싱 전략 등)
테스트 코드 작성
React 테스트(Jest, React Testing Library)
FastAPI 테스트 (Pytest)
확장성 및 아키텍처 설계 실습
REST API 설계의 고급 주제 (리소스 구조, 에러 처리)
I will create a slide that follows the same structure and design principles as the previous slides, especially slide 6. Let me design it with a modern, code editor-like dark background and bright accent colors for important elements.

For this slide, I'll use a color theme that represents advanced topics, with a focus on performance and optimization. Since this is the last substantive week of the curriculum, I'll use colors that indicate completion and mastery - perhaps with purple/blue tones for performance optimization, green tones for testing, and orange/red for architecture design.

I'll organize the content into 4 distinct sections:

Performance Monitoring & Optimization
Testing Code
Scalability & Architecture Design
Final Project Goals
Let me create the HTML now.
